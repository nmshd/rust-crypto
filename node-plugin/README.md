**Crypto Layer TS interface for nodejs.**

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

## Building crypto-layer-node

Building crypto-layer-node requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

To run the build, run:

```pwsh
npm i
npm run build
```

This command uses the [@neon-rs/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neon-rs/cli) utility to assemble the binary Node addon from the output of `cargo`.

## Debugging

* Compile the library with debug:

    ```
    npm run debug
    ```

* Activate logging:

    ```bash
    RUST_LOG=trace
    ```

    ```pwsh
    $env:RUST_LOG="trace"
    ```

    Available levels are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`.

    It is possible to filter according to modules (see the [docs](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html)).

* Activate full backtrace:

    ```bash
    RUST_BACKTRACE=full
    ```

    ```pwsh
    $env:RUST_BACKTRACE="full"
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source, generating a release build with `cargo --release`.

Additional [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) arguments may be passed to `npm run build` and similar commands. For example, to enable a [cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):

```
npm run build -- --feature=beetle
```

#### `npm run debug`

Similar to `npm run build` but generates a debug build with `cargo`.

#### `npm run cross`

Similar to `npm run build` but uses [cross-rs](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to cross-compile for another platform. Use the [`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildtarget) environment variable to select the build target.

#### `npm run release`

Initiate a full build and publication of a new patch release of this library via GitHub Actions.

#### `npm run dryrun`

Initiate a dry run of a patch release of this library via GitHub Actions. This performs a full build but does not publish the final result.

#### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests written with `jest`.

The project must be compiled with `npm run debug` (recommended) or `npm run build` beforehand.

Consider running the tests with logging and full backtrace:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info RUST_BACKTRACE=full npm test
```
