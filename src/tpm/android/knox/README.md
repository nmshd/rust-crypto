## rust-crypto-knox
Welcome! Here you will find a wrapper that is used to perform cryptographic operations for mobile applications on an Android devices Secure Element (SE), specifically focused on Samsung Knox Vault. The interface to the mobile application is provided in Rust, while the communication with the SE is done using the Android Keystore System.

### Functions
Our wrapper has the following functionalities implemented:
- generating and loading keys with a smartphones Secure Element
- encrypting and decrypting with a symmetric key
- signing and verifying with an asymmetric key

For more specific information (e.g. supported cryptographic algorithms) please refer to the documentation linked below.

### Installation and Documentation

For an installation guide, please refer to [the Documentation](../../../../Documentation/Doc.md).

### Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to the Crypto Layer are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the project's GitHub repository.
