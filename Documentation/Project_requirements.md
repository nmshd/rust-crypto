# Project requirements

These are the requirements defined at the start of the project by Vulcan's Limes in collaboration with j&s-soft. They represent the original goals at the start of the project and are the foundation for all further development. Whether the requirements have been met is described below.

## Functional requirements



|Requirement | Status  | Status explanation
|--|--|--|
| 1. Secure key management: The wrapper must be able to generate, store and manage keys securely using the HSM.  | Complete | |
| 2. Integration with Samsung Knox Vault: The wrapper must enable the abstraction layer to use the functions of Knox Vault. | Partially complete | Key Usages are not implemented |
| 3. Access control: The wrapper must ensure that only a correctly authorized application can access the services of the wrapper. | Not verified | The planned pentest has not completed as of June 2024 |
| 4. Encryption and decryption: The wrapper must offer to encrypt and decrypt data using the keys stored in the HSM. | Partially complete | Asymmetric Encryption is not yet implemented
| 5. Logging and monitoring: The wrapper must provide a mechanism for logging of key operations and monitoring of access to keys stored in the Knox Vault in order to detect possible security breaches | Complete | Logging is provided by the abstraction layer 

## Non-functional requirements

|Requirement | Status  | Status explanation
|--|--|--|
| 1. Security: The wrapper must manage the keys securely. To check this requirement, j&s-soft carries out a pentest and incorporates the feedback into the wrapper. | Not verified |  The planned pentest has not completed as of June 2024 |
| 2. Performance: The wrapper must be able to perform frequent operations such as data encryption and decryption in less than one second, provided that this is supported by the hardware security module. | not achievable | Encryption speed with AES-256 is about 0.1 mB/s
| 3. Reliability: The wrapper must provide a suitable response for correct requests and respond with an error message for incorrect requests. | Complete |
| 4. Compatibility: The wrapper must be compatible with all devices that currently support Knox Vault. A list of these devices can be found in the Documentation. Compliance with this requirement can only be checked for devices that are available to Vulcan's Limes. | Complete for S22 | Samsung S22 is the only device provided for testing
| 5. Integration with Samsung Knox SDK: The wrapper must be integrated with the Samsung Knox SDK in order to access and use the security functions and capabilities of Knox Vault. | Outdated | The wrapper is using the Android Keystore API to achieve this requirement
| 8. Implementation of the abstraction layer: The wrapper must enable all implementable functions of the abstraction layer | partially complete | Asymmetric Encryption and Key Usage are not implemented yet 
| 9. Programming language: The wrapper is written in the Rust programming language. | Complete | 
| 6. Maintainability: The code of the wrapper is documented so that any subsequent further development by other persons is possible. | Complete | 
| 7. Documentation: Documentation is provided for the wrapper that describes installation, configuration and use. | Complete |
