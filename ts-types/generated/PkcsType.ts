/**
 * Enumerates the PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) types.
 *
 * Specifies the different PKCS standards, covering a wide array of cryptographic
 * functionalities, including key exchange, encryption, and digital signatures.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting a PKCS type for RSA cryptography:
 *
 * ```rust
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::pkcs::standards::PkcsType;
 *
 * fn main() {
 *     let pkcs_type = PkcsType::Pkcs1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * `#[repr(C)]` attribute for C compatibility.
