 * Error wrapping native errors.

 * The native libraries used large lists of errors that might occur.
 * This struct exists to dumb down said errors.
 * The provider implementation should map errors from native libraries to this enum.
 * Most if not all errors should have a source for backtraces.
 * If other fields are useful for understanding the error, they should also exist.
