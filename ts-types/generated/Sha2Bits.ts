/**
 * Specifies the digest sizes for the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms.
 *
 * This enum lists the supported digest sizes for SHA-2, providing a range of options
 * for different security and performance needs. The larger the digest size, the higher
 * the security level and collision resistance, but with a potential decrease in performance.
 * Selecting the appropriate digest size depends on the specific requirements of the application,
 * balancing security against computational overhead.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting a SHA-2 digest size:
 *
 * ```rust
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::algorithms::hashes::Sha2Bits;
 *
 * let digest_size = Sha2Bits::Sha512;
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * `#[repr(C)]` attribute is used for C compatibility, facilitating interoperability with C-based systems.
