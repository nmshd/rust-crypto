/**
 * Specifies the curve types for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
 *
 * Lists the supported elliptic curve specifications for ECDSA, affecting security and performance.
 * Includes both NIST P-curves and others like secp256k1 and Brainpool curves.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting an ECDSA curve:
 *
 * ```
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::algorithms::encryption::EccCurve;
 *
 * let curve_type = EccCurve::P256;
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * Uses `#[repr(C)]` for C language compatibility.
