/**
 * Represents the available hashing algorithms.
 *
 * This enum provides a C-compatible representation of various hashing algorithms,
 * including both historically significant and modern, secure algorithms.
 *
 * When choosing a hashing algorithm, consider its security level and known vulnerabilities.
 * Algorithms like SHA-1, MD2, MD4, and MD5 are considered insecure for most cryptographic
 * purposes due to practical collision attacks and should be avoided for new applications.
 * Prefer using more secure algorithms like SHA-2 or SHA-3 for cryptographic purposes.
