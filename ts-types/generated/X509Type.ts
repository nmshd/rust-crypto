/**
 * Enumerates the types within the X.509 standard.
 *
 * Specifies the different elements associated with X.509, a standard for creating
 * a public key infrastructure for digital certificates and public-key encryption.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting an X.509 type for certificates:
 *
 * ```rust
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::pkcs::standards::X509Type;
 *
 * fn main() {
 *     let x509_type = X509Type::Certificate;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * Uses `#[repr(C)]` for compatibility with C language standards, facilitating use
 * in systems where interoperability with C is required.
