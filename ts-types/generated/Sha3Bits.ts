/**
 * Specifies the digest sizes for the SHA-3 family of hashing algorithms.
 *
 * SHA-3, also known as Keccak, offers a range of digest sizes to accommodate various
 * security levels and performance requirements. As a newer standard compared to SHA-2,
 * SHA-3 introduces a different cryptographic design that is resilient against many of the
 * vulnerabilities that affect older hashing algorithms. Choosing the correct digest size
 * allows developers to optimize for security and efficiency based on their specific needs.
 * A larger digest size generally provides higher security and collision resistance but may
 * come with a performance trade-off.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting a SHA-3 digest size:
 *
 * ```rust
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::algorithms::hashes::Sha3Bits;
 *
 * fn main() {
 *     let digest_size = Sha3Bits::Sha3_384;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * Uses `#[repr(C)]` for C language compatibility, important for interoperability with C-based systems.
