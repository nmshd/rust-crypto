/**
 * Specifies the modes of operation for symmetric block ciphers.
 *
 * This enum lists the supported modes of operation, such as GCM, CCM, ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR.
 * These modes determine how block ciphers process plaintext and ciphertext, affecting security and performance characteristics.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting AES in GCM mode:
 *
 * ```rust
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::algorithms::encryption::SymmetricMode;
 *
 * let mode = SymmetricMode::Gcm;
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * `#[repr(C)]` attribute is used for C compatibility.
