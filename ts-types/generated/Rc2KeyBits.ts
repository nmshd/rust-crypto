/**
 * Specifies the key sizes for the RC2 block cipher.
 *
 * This enum lists the supported key sizes for RC2, such as 40, 64, and 128 bits.
 * The selection of key size impacts the security and compatibility of the encryption process.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting an RC2 key size of 128 bits:
 *
 * ```rust
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::algorithms::encryption:: Rc2KeyBits;
 *
 * let key_size = Rc2KeyBits::Rc2_128;
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * Marked with `#[repr(C)]` to ensure compatibility with C-based environments.
