/**
 * Specifies the number of keys used in Triple DES configurations.
 *
 * This enum provides options for two-key (Ede2) and three-key (Ede3) Triple DES configurations.
 * The choice between two-key and three-key configurations affects the security level and performance of the encryption process.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Selecting a Triple DES configuration with three keys:
 *
 * ```rust
 * use crypto_layer::common::crypto::algorithms::encryption::TripleDesNumKeys;
 *
 * let des_config = TripleDesNumKeys::Tdes3;
 * ```
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * Uses `#[repr(C)]` for C language compatibility.
